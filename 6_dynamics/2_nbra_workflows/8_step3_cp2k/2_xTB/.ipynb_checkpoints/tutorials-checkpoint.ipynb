    "# Computing the nonadiabatic couplings in Kohn-Sham and excited states bases in extended tight-binding framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start computing the nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) from the molecular orbital overlap files obtained in [step2](../../7_step2_cp2k/2_xTB). The NACs will be computed in Kohn-Sham states but only in single-partcile (SP) excited state basis, not many-body (MB) states, because we did not perform TD-DFT. Finally we will plot the excited states energies vs time and NAC map.\n",
