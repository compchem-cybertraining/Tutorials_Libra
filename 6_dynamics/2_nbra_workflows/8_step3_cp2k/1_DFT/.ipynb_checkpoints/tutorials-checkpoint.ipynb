    "# Computing the nonadiabatic couplings in Kohn-Sham and excited states bases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start computing the nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) from the molecular orbital overlap files obtained in [step2](../../7_step2_cp2k/1_DFT). The NACs will be computed in Kohn-Sham states and also in both single-partcile (SP) and many-body (MB) excited state bases. Finally we will plot the excited states energies vs time and NAC map.\n",

    "In this section, we will plot the average partial density of states (pDOS) over the MD trajectory. There are two ways to take the average of the pDOS:\n",

    "We choose the first one due to two reasons. First, the computational cost is much lower and we only need one convolution. Second is that averaging over the grid points (using the method 2) is dependent on the number of grid points we use for convolution which again adds to the complexity of the procedure. \n",

    "In this part, we plot the pDOS for all of the angular momentum components of each atom. This is done by using the `orbital_cols`. In fact, the `orbital_cols` is related to `orbitals`. For example, for `s` orbital, we consider the 3rd index and for `p` orbital, we sum the columns from 4 to 6 (`range(4,7)`). Here we want to show how the code works and how the you can modify that based on your project. In the next section, we will show the pDOS only for atoms and sum all the components in each row of the pdos file. Other parameters are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`atoms`: The atoms names which will be used in the labeling and plotting. The atoms order should be exactly the same as appear in the `.pdos` files. For example, the `*k1*.pdos` files contain the pDOS data for `Ti` atom and `*k2*.pdos` files contain the data for the `O` atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "`npoints`: The number of grid points for making the Gaussian functions. Note that, this value should be more than the number of states in the `.pdos` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sigma`: The standard deviation in eV.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shift`: This value shifts the minimum and maximum energy found in the `pdos_ave` and will extend the boundaries from both sides by `shift`eV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will plot the total density of states. Note that the HOMO energy level is set to zero."
