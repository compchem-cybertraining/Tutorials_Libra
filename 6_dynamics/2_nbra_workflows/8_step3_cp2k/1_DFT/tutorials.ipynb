    "# Computing the nonadiabatic couplings in Kohn-Sham and excited states bases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start computing the nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) from the molecular orbital overlap files obtained in [step2](../../7_step2_cp2k/1_DFT). The NACs will be computed in Kohn-Sham states and also in both single-partcile (SP) and many-body (MB) excited state bases. Finally we will plot the excited states energies vs time and NAC map.\n",
