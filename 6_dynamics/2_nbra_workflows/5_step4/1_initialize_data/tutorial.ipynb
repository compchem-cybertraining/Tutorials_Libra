    "Up until now, we have been using the Kohn-Sham basis we generated in the step2 calculations with Quantum Espresso. Recall that we also had taken these Kohn-Sham orbitals and formed a slater determinant basis, in which the Slater determinant energies were approximated as the sums of the 1-electron energies of the underlying Kohn-sham orbitals. Also please recall that we named the files storing the Hamiltonian in the Slater determinant basis, Hvib_sorted_#_(re/im). Therefore, we need to change the path, `params[\"data_set_paths\"]`, to the correct data. \n",

    "Furthermore, we had used Libra to auto-generate our Slater determinant basis. Specifically, Libra generated 17 Slater determinants. Therefore, we need to change the number of states, `params[\"nstates\"]`, we extract from the Hamiltonian files. "
