    "# Running the computation of the molecular orbital overlaps and time-overlaps using Libra/CP2K interface in DFT framework on HPCs \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will compute the molecular orbital (MO) overlaps and time-overlaps using the Libra/CP2K interface and Libint2 library. Detailed information are given in the [README.md](../README.md) and [../1_desktop/tutorial.ipynb](../1_desktop/tutorial.ipynb) files. In this notebook, we will test it by using only one job and for the pre-computed MD trajectory obtained from the previous step in [here](../../6_step1_cp2k).\n",
